# ForskScope Roadmap

**Last updated:** v0.164.0 (2026-07-10)
**Current phase:** Release-readiness verification — security, dependency, archive, CI, and docs gates aligned; runtime/platform verification remains.

---

## Current state

The `forskscope-core` and `forskscope-ui-logic` crates are feature-complete for
the v1 two-way diff/merge workflow. The current observed headless gate passes
**930 tests** with zero failures: 643 core unit tests, 45 core integration
tests, 228 ui-logic unit tests, 6 CSS integration tests, and 8 doctests.

The UI crate (`forskscope-ui`) has the v1 two-way workflow implemented:
two-pane diff with independent pane labels and shared horizontal scroll;
English/Japanese translation-key coverage enforced by `cargo xtask i18n`
(203 `t(...)` keys); per-file and batch copy in the directory report view;
F3/Shift+F3 search navigation; compare profiles; session restore; patch export;
and release-gate CSS freshness checks.

Release-readiness hardening completed after v0.140.0:

- XLSX parsing was security-disabled: `.xlsx` files are recognized but
  comparison fails closed until the `sheets-diff -> calamine -> quick-xml`
  dependency path is remediated.
- Dioxus desktop network-capable transitive dependencies were reviewed. Default
  Dioxus features/devtools are disabled, and the accepted loopback WebSocket IPC
  path is enforced by `cargo xtask audit-deps`.
- Source archives now have a no-parent-directory contract, verified locally and
  in the release workflow by `cargo xtask archive-layout`.
- CI and release preflight now run the documented gates: format, CSS, audit,
  dependency-path audit, version sync, i18n coverage, tests, and clippy. Release
  tags are checked against the workspace version before artifacts are created.

The remaining release work is runtime/platform verification: GTK smoke tests,
WebKitGTK visual checks, and packaging verification on Linux, macOS, and
Windows. Three-way merge conflict workspace UI, command palette, and editor
adapter work remain post-v1.

## UI implementation slices — status at v0.164.0

The remaining work is a series of UI slices that wire the Dioxus components
to the core types. Each slice delivers a testable, usable increment.

### ✓ Slice 1 — Diff view renders and navigates *(shipped)*

**Goal:** A user can open two files, see the diff rendered with correct
colour + gutter symbols, and navigate prev/next hunk with keyboard.

**Core types consumed:**
- `DiffDecorationSet::from_diff` → CSS classes, gutter symbols, aria labels
- `LineMap::from_diff` → aligned row sequence, `ScrollAnchor`
- `cmd::NEXT_DIFFERENCE`, `cmd::PREV_DIFFERENCE` → `CommandRegistry`
- `FileSizeClass::classify` → large-file prompt before diff

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Line diff renders in two synchronised panes with correct decoration classes
- `F7`/`F8` navigate hunks; both panes scroll together
- Large files (> 4 MiB) show the FileSizeClass prompt before diffing

---

### ✓ Slice 2 — Merge actions wire to core *(shipped)*

**Goal:** A user can apply hunks left-to-right, undo, and see the dirty-state
marker in the tab title.

**Core types consumed:**
- `TextEditOperation::Replace` → applied to result buffer
- `TransactionLog::push` / `undo` / `redo`
- `WorkspaceSession::mark_tab_dirty` / `mark_tab_clean`
- `cmd::COPY_HUNK_LEFT_RIGHT`, `cmd::UNDO`, `cmd::REDO`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Apply-hunk updates the right-pane rendered content
- Ctrl+Z undoes the last merge; Ctrl+Y/Ctrl+Shift+Z redoes
- Tab title shows `*` when dirty; clears after save

---

### ✓ Slice 3 — Save with safety checks *(shipped)*

**Goal:** A user can save a merge result; external modification is detected
and the reconciliation dialog is shown.

**Core types consumed:**
- `save_text` with `AtomicSaveStrategy` and `BackupPolicy`
- `check_external_state` before write
- `AppError::from_core` → `RecoveryAction` → dialog buttons
- `cmd::SAVE`, `cmd::SAVE_AS`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Save writes atomically and optionally creates a `.bak` backup
- External modification triggers the reconciliation dialog
  (Compare / Reload / Save As / Cancel)
- Failed save preserves dirty state

---

### ✓ Slice 4 — Explorer and directory compare *(shipped)*

**Goal:** A user can browse two directories and see equal/modified/only-left
/only-right status icons.

**Core types consumed:**
- `DirectoryIndex::from_records` + `pair_entries` → `EqualityEvidence`
- `JobRegistry` → progress bar while scanning
- `ConflictFilter` / `AvailabilityRule::SelectedPathExists` → explorer actions
- `ExternalToolCommand::file_manager_reveal` → "Reveal in Finder" action

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Digest icons show ✓ / ⚠ / left-only / right-only correctly
- Progress bar shown while background digest jobs run
- Double-click same-name file opens diff tab (RFC-054 §2-ii)

---

### ✓ Slice 5 — Settings dialog *(shipped)*

**Goal:** A user can change theme, font size, compare profile, and newline
policy from a settings dialog; changes persist across restarts.

**Core types consumed:**
- `UserSettings::to_json` / `from_json` → config file read/write
- `ThemeId::css_var_names` → CSS variable injection
- `CompareProfile::all_presets` → profile dropdown
- `BomPolicy`, `NewlinePolicy` → file settings section

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Settings persist to `~/.config/forskscope/settings.json`
- Theme change applies immediately without restart
- Unknown settings file fields are silently ignored (schema v1 forward-compat)

---

### ○ Slice 6 — Three-way merge workspace *(core complete; UI deferred post-v1)*

**Goal:** A user can open a three-way merge session, resolve conflicts with
Use Left / Use Right / Edit, and save the merged result.

**Core types consumed:**
- `ThreeWayMergeSession::from_texts`
- `ConflictNavigator::build` → navigator rail
- `resolve_left` / `resolve_right` / `resolve_manual` / `ignore`
- `can_save()` → save-block predicate
- `cmd::USE_LEFT`, `cmd::USE_RIGHT`, `cmd::NEXT_CONFLICT`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Navigator rail shows `!`/`L`/`R`/`B`/`~`/`-` status for each conflict
- Keyboard: `Alt+L` / `Alt+R` resolve focused conflict
- Ctrl+S disabled while any conflict is unresolved; enabled when all resolved

---

### ○ Slice 7 — Command palette *(deferred post-v1)*

**Goal:** A user can open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), type to
filter, and execute any available command.

**Core types consumed:**
- `CommandRegistry::builtin()` + `search(query)`
- `AvailabilityRule::evaluate(ctx)` → disabled-with-reason
- `CommandContext` snapshot from session state

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Palette filters commands by label and description (case-insensitive)
- Unavailable commands show as dimmed with tooltip reason
- Escape closes palette; Enter executes selected command

---

### ○ Slice 8 — Editor adapter prototype *(gated on RFC-004; post-v1)*

**Goal:** Text editing is model-backed; edits flow through
`TextEditOperation` and diff is recomputed on change.

**Gate:** Requires a stable CodeMirror or equivalent editor integration.
This slice is not on the critical path for a functional v1 (the result
buffer can be write-only in v1), but is required for full manual-edit support.

**Core types consumed:**
- `TextEditOperation`, `RevisionId`, `OperationAck`/`OperationReject`
- `EditTransaction` + `TransactionLog`
- `DiffDecorationSet` → editor decoration push

## Non-goals (unchanged)

ForskScope is not and will not become:
- A full Git GUI
- An IDE
- A cloud diff service
- A file synchronization suite
- A universal document comparator
- An AI auto-merge agent
- A plugin marketplace
